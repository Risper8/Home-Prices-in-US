## Analysis Steps

* Data Preprocessing: The raw data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries were used to explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns in the data.

* Modeling: Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated.

* Model Evaluation: Model performance metrics such as r-squared, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error were calculated to assess model performance.

* Model Interpretation: The most important features contributing to model predictions were identified.

* Results: Random Forest outperformed other models in terms of predictive accuracy.
